# This is the README of the slm_colors project

## Task:
You should implement a REST-based server in Java (use Spring Boot). The service should
be able to return the desired information using REST.

## Requirements
Use GitHub or Azure DevOps for the project and follow the correct DevOps procedure. Use a
Kanban board to manage your User Stories and use a git branching model (preferable
gitflow) to manage your code. Track your development process by updating your Kanban
board and write at least one unit tests for every requirement. A Continuous Integration
pipeline that produces the finished software artifact should be implemented as well.
Document
<li>the whole process</li>
<li>the user stories</li>
<li>the repository URL</li>
<li>the usage of the software</li>

in a Readme file with explanatory text. Submit the code (including the .git folder and ALM
files) as a zip file (please put the Readme inside the zip file).
<br>
You can use external resources as long as you mark them: as an URL


## Implementation

Because of the basic requirements no ExceptionHandling was build therefore a default value was used in the case of a color (the default value is "red")
